    <h1>Some call me Joe Money Greene</h1>
    <h2>DO YOU KNOW IM CODING OFFICIALLY</h2>
    <p>
      Code has seriously changed me! When I look back over the summer, I am pleased
      to say that I have come along the way. I am looking forward to the future me
      who is commited to this transformation. I feel like this stepping stone is a
      blessing. I really do enjoy General Assembly. Even though it is a challenging
       experience, I am grateful for allowing me to be a part of GA. I am forever
       indebted to the staff who have been a lifesaver for me.

      It was very difficult to truly feel like I am a coder. I am a Web developer.
      I struggled so much that I needed to look in the mirror and figure out do I really
      want this. I always felt that I wasnt ready to quit during the times of frustration
      when I couldnt keep up to comprehend the material. I made a promise not to quit on
      myself and to James. My summer has just been a wirlwind of events I have not
      had the time to fully access, but I can truly say that I can make it and get through
      life. I am happy even when the struggle was REAL. Im not the best. At times I felt like
      the worst. I know that I do have a Heart. I am glad that the Chicago GA staff never
      gave up on me. THANKU THANKU THANKU THANKU THANKU THANKU THANKU THANKU THANKU
